# Rust Platform Support

The Rust compiler runs on, and compiles to, a great number of platforms, though
not all platforms are equally supported. Rust's support levels are organized
into three tiers, each with a different set of guarantees.

Platforms are identified by their "target triple" which is the string to inform
the compiler what kind of output should be produced. The columns below indicate
whether the corresponding component works on the specified platform.

## Tier 1

Tier 1 platforms can be thought of as "guaranteed to build and work".
Specifically they will each satisfy the following requirements:

* Automated testing is set up to run tests for the platform.
* Landing changes to the `rust-lang/rust` repository's master branch is gated on
  tests passing.
* Official release artifacts are provided for the platform.
* Documentation for how to use and how to build the platform is available.

|-------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------------------|
| `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`      |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  | 64-bit MSVC (Windows 7+)   |
| `i686-pc-windows-gnu`         |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  | 32-bit MinGW (Windows 7+)  |
| `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`       |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  | 64-bit MinGW (Windows 7+)  |
| `i686-apple-darwin`           |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  | 32-bit OSX (10.7+, Lion+)  |
| `x86_64-apple-darwin`         |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  | 64-bit OSX (10.7+, Lion+)  |
| `i686-unknown-linux-gnu`      |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  | 32-bit Linux (2.6.18+)     |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`    |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  | 64-bit Linux (2.6.18+)     |

## Tier 2

Tier 2 platforms can be thought of as "guaranteed to build". Automated tests
are not run so it's not guaranteed to produce a working build, but platforms
often work to quite a good degree and patches are always welcome! Specifically,
these platforms are required to have each of the following:

* Automated building is set up, but may not be running tests.
* Landing changes to the `rust-lang/rust` repository's master branch is gated on
  platforms **building**. Note that this means for some platforms only the
  standard library is compiled, but for others the full bootstrap is run.
* Official release artifacts are provided for the platform.

|  Target                       | std |rustc|cargo| notes                      |
|-------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------------------|
| `i686-pc-windows-msvc`        |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  | 32-bit MSVC (Windows 7+)   |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`   |  ✓  |     |     | 64-bit Linux with MUSL     |
| `arm-linux-androideabi`       |  ✓  |     |     | ARM Android                |
| `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi`   |  ✓  |  ✓  |     | ARM Linux (2.6.18+)        |
| `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` |  ✓  |  ✓  |     | ARM Linux (2.6.18+)        |
| `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`   |  ✓  |     |     | ARM64 Linux (2.6.18+)      |
| `mips-unknown-linux-gnu`      |  ✓  |     |     | MIPS Linux (2.6.18+)       |
| `mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu`    |  ✓  |     |     | MIPS (LE) Linux (2.6.18+)  |

## Tier 3

Tier 3 platforms are those which Rust has support for, but landing changes is
not gated on the platform either building or passing tests. Working builds for
these platforms may be spotty as their reliability is often defined in terms of
community contributions. Additionally, release artifacts and installers are not
provided, but there may be community infrastructure producing these in
unofficial locations.
